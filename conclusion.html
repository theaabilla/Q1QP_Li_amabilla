            <h2>CONCLUSION</h2><br>
            <p>In our study of qualitative data, most of the countries we used  populations ranging from 0 to 20 million. Surprisingly, there are a few countries with populations between 60 to 80 million and 100 to 150 million. When we analyzed the continents, Europe stood out as the predominant continent among the two continents we examined.
            </p><br>
            <p>On the other hand, in our quantitative data, we discovered an interesting trend: women tend to live longer than men in these countries. Additionally, the fertility rate in these nations are generally low, suggesting a possible link between fertility rates and male life expectancy. Itâ€™s intriguing to note that even in Asian countries with high fertility rates, female life expectancy still surpasses that of males. This hints that the possibility that factors like anatomy, environment, and even religious beliefs, particularly in Muslim-majority regions like Central Asia, could play a role in expectancy.
            </p><br>  
            <p>Our findings can address concerns related to overpopulation and early mortality. By going deeper into the male and female biology, as well as their surroundings, future research can shed more light on these patterns. Understanding these might pave the way for more targeted interventions and policies.</p><br>
